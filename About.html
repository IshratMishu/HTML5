        <p>"The X-65 conventional surfaces are like training wheels to help us understand how AFC can be used in place of traditional flaps and rudders," Richard Wlezien, program manager for CRANE, said in a DARPA statement.
        "We'll have sensors in place to monitor how the AFC effector's performance compares with traditional control mechanisms, and these data will help us better understand how AFC could revolutionize both military and commercial craft in the future."</p>

        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Space.com launched in New York City on July 20, 1999, the 30th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, with the goal of covering the latest discoveries and missions in space like never before. The company was originally founded by news anchor Lou Dobbs and Rich Zahradnick, with Zahradnik serving as our first President, a position later filled by Sally Ride â€” the first American woman in space. Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, was on the board of directors.

            In 2003, Space.com received the Online Journalism Award for Breaking News by the Online News Association in recognition of our coverage of the 2003 Columbia space shuttle disaster. It has since received Webby awards as an Honoree in the Science category in 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014.
            
            In May 2004, Space.com's parent company changed its name from Space Holdings to Imaginova. In 2009, Space.com was acquired by Tech Media Network, later called Purch. 
            
            In 2018, Future plc acquired Space.com's parent company Purch. As part of Future, Space.com has expanded its news and reviews team across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom for wider spaceflight and astronomy coverage. We've also grown to offer additional telescopes, binoculars and astrophotography reviews and deals coverage alongside our tech, gaming and sci-fi streaming coverage. 
            
            Space.com is, and always has been, the passion of writers and editors who are space fans and also trained journalists.</p>
